# portfolio_website_using_plsql

- In this project I used HTML and CSS along with a little bit of js to create the front end of the portfolio website. 
- I used PhP to connect the database and the front end. I store the information which is given in the `contact me` page and store it in a database table.
- I used a SQL procedure which inserts the information received from the contact page.

# Instructions in case you want to run this on your device:
- First of all install `xampp` on your device.
- Start the xampp and then click start on the following: `Apache`, `MySQL`
- The project folder should be in the `C:\xampp\htdocs` otherwise the project would not load.
- In the browser type `localhost/index.html` it would show you the finished project.
